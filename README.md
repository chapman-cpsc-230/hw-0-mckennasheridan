# Git Workflow

**Author:** McKenna Sheridan

**Due date:** February 9, 2016

## Description

For this assignment, I had to retrieve this file from the GitHub cloud and download it onto my machine. Once downloaded, I had to edit this file, save it, and send it back to the GitHub cloud.

## What I Learned from This

This assignment taught me how to use GitHub and retrieve Git files from the cloud. I also learned how to use the editer, Atom, to edit Git files.

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,

McKenna Sheridan
